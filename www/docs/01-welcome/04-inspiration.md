# Inspiration

Loco Sync was heavily inspired by the videos Linear has released on its own sync engine implementation:

- [Real-time sync for web apps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxK11RsLqp4&t=2175s)
- [Scaling the Linear Sync Engine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo2m3jaJixU)

Loco Sync was also influenced by a number of other projects in the local-first ecosystem, including:

- [Automerge](https://automerge.org/)
- [Replicache](https://replicache.dev/)
- [TinyBase](https://tinybase.org/)
